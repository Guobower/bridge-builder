# bridge-builder
Bridgebuilder does provide a set of tools to create oddo, flectra, cubicerp and similar odoo based erp systems

it is based on a tool that has been developed for internal use  
during the last couple of years  
[odoo_instances](https://gitlab.redcor.ch/open-source/odoo_instances)  
[odoo_instances/installation](https://gitlab.redcor.ch/open-source/odoo_instances/install/INSTALL.txt')

odoo_instances is used to create local and remote odoo sites, create adn update docker_instances with running mirror of the local sites, doing ackups and a number of other dayly chores.

Its main features will be reimplemented in bridge-builder such that we can create functionally identical sites in any of the suported erp systems.
